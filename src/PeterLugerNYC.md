# Peter Luger in New York City

**Date:** June 16, 2025 â€” *New York City, New York*

Peter Luger Steak House is a legendary restaurant in Brooklyn, New York.
This is my first time dine in Peter Luger.
It used to have Michelin star, but lost it in 2022 due to inconsistent food quality, according to [this news](https://www.tastingtable.com/1756619/peter-luger-steak-house-pete-wells-not-impressed/).
Despite all these negative news, I personal think I had a good time there.

As the following pictures show, the interior design is luxury and traditional style.

We were seated in a table by the window.
Somehow I feel the scene outside looks better when I am inside this historical restaurant.

I did not really research the restaurant, and once I saw there's a lunch special of sausage on the menu, I realize this is German restaurant.
We can also observe this from the decoration on the wall.

The waitor is nice and kind, only speaks whenever necessary.
Immediately after we ordered, the bread came out alongsize with the steak sauce.
The steak sauce is special to me, with some cocktail sauce flavor in it.
I really like it.

We ordered the bacon and caeser salad as appetizers.
The bacon is amazing.
Unlike supermarket one, this one is not as salty, and maintain a decent thickness so we can taste the meaty flavor of it.
I followed up and ordered the sausage lunch special because how amazing this bacon is.
