# Aggregate Implication of Corporate Taxation over Business Cycle

I examine the aggregate effects of corporate taxation using a quantitative dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model featuring firms subject to collateralized borrowing and idiosyncratic productivity shocks.
In my model economy, two policies subsidize capital investment through corporate tax deductions.
Firms that invest less than a threshold defined by the IRS enjoy lower user cost of capital, while others deduct their capital expenditure at a counter-cyclical bonus rate.
Increasing the threshold is 50% more effective than raising the bonus rate in stimulating aggregate output while combining both policies reduces effectiveness by 13% compared to solely increasing the threshold.
Although a higher bonus rate benefits more firms, unconstrained firms often distribute saved funds as dividends rather than reinvesting, diminishing policy efficacy per dollar of foregone government revenue.
Conversely, raising the threshold empowers credit-constrained firms to overcome collateral limitations, thereby reducing capital misallocation due to financial frictions.
