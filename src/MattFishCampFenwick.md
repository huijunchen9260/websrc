# Matt's Fish Camp in Fenwick Island

**Date:** June 11–12, 2025 — *Fenwick Island, Delaware*

There’s no sales tax in Delaware.
That became our main motivation to dine across the state line during our time in Ocean City.

We found this place called **Matt’s Fish Camp**, and they had an amazing happy hour—**buck-a-shuck oysters** and **50-cent clams** from 4 PM to 6 PM.
I’ve never seen prices like that before.
So of course, we went there twice—once wasn’t enough. We went for both happy hour and dinner.

## Swordfish for Dinner

We tried the swordfish as our main dish.
It was meaty and lean. I personally liked it, but my partner wasn’t a fan.

## Solving the "FI" Salmon Mystery

On the first day, I noticed the salmon was labeled as coming from "FI," which didn’t match any U.S. state abbreviation.
We figured it out the next day at *Sea Shell City*, a nearby gift shop—**FI stands for Fenwick Island**.

So naturally, we ordered the "FI" salmon the next day.
As always, salmon didn’t disappoint me.

## Oysters and Clams: So Fresh

We ordered a dozen oysters and a dozen clams.
They were unbelievably fresh. That’s when I realized the weird aftertaste I’d experienced with oysters from Whole Foods in Columbus wasn’t normal.

Each oyster and clam here was smooth and briny—nothing like what I’d had before.
Now I understand why people say **oysters are addictive**.
