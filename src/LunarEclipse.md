# Lunar Eclipse

Date: March 14, 2025 at Upper Arlington, Columbus, Ohio

I stayed awake until 3 AM on March 14.

This is how it looks like in prediction.

This is the pictures that I took, using my Google Pixel, zoomed in 5X.

For some reason, if I did not zoom in, then I can see the light beside the moon, which is not visible by eyes, but can be captured by camera.
