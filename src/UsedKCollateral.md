I study how much financial frictions and the endogeneity of partially irreversible
capital explain the slow recovery of the Great Recession. I propose a heterogeneous
firm model with real and financial frictions. Firms adjust their capital stock by trading
on the used capital market; thus, the capital partial irreversibility is endogenized by the
price in the market. This irreversibility creates two opposite forces affecting investment
volatility. First, capital investment is relatively cheaper in the recession, and thus
attracts firms to invest in capital, dampening the fall of aggregate investment. Second,
in a downturn, the capital becomes less reversible, and investments become riskier,
exacerbating the fall of aggregate investment. In my model, the collateral constraint is
procyclical since it is based on the resale value of the capital, and thus amplifies the first
force and dampens the response of aggregate investment. I found that in the steady
state, the used capital market induces firms to stay financially constrained due to lower
effective capital prices. This status however may put these firms in a vulnerable position
when the value of their collateral drops during a recession, as they heavily depend on
debt to finance their capital investment. However, the perfect foresight exercise shows
that the time-varying collateral constraint channel is relatively small. The main channel
lies in the used capital market price, which acts as an automatic stabilizer during the
credit crisis.
