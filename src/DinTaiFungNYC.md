# Din Tai Fung at New York City

**Date:** June 15, 2025 — *New York City, New York*

As a Taiwanese, we have high standard for Taiwanese cuisine.
Among all Taiwanese restaurant chain, Din Tai Fung is probably the most famous one.
Din Tai Fung is well-known for Xiao Long Bao 小籠包 (soup dumplings) and fried rice.
In 2024, Din Tai Fung opened the first East Coast location in New York City, and finally I have a chance to come and taste it.
This location is also the only one that serves alcohol.

The interior design of the restaurant is fabulous.
As we can see in the following pictures, it is in traditional style of Taiwanese housing, which inherit some of the Chinese style.

The restaurant is pack of people.
You probably cannot dine in without reservation.
Even with reservation, it took us roughly 20 minutes from checking in to get a table.
